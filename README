jQuery AS3 Webcam, you will be able to make JPEG captures of web camera, all interactions are made thru javascript.
Javascript callback will receive base64 encoded JPEG image from webcamera.

/* SWF external interface:
 * webcam.save() - get base64 encoded JPEG image 
 * webcam.getCameraList() - get list of available cams
 * webcam.setCamera(i) - set camera, camera index retrieved with getCameraList
 * */

/* External triggers on events:
 * webcam.isClientReady() - you respond to SWF with true (by default) meaning javascript is ready to accept callbacks
 * webcam.cameraConnected() - camera connected callback from SWF
 * webcam.noCameraFound() - SWF response that it cannot find any suitable camera
 * webcam.cameraEnabled() - SWF response when camera tracking is enabled (this is called multiple times, use isCameraEnabled flag)
 * webcam.cameraDisabled()- SWF response, user denied usage of camera
 * webcam.swfApiFail()    - Javascript failed to make call to SWF
 * webcam.debug()         - debug callback used from SWF and can be used from javascript side too
